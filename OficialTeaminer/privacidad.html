        <h1>  TEAMINER
            
            <br>
            Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>   
           

At Teaminer, we want you to know that we respect your privacy, the privacy of our Members and the privacy 
of our customers. This document provides information regarding our policy as it relates to the collection,
 use and disclosure of personal information. It also outlines our customer's rights to limit the collection 
 use or disclosure of personal information. Personal information may include your name, email, mailing and/or 
 business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. We at Teaminer hold this
  personal information seriously and we maintain this information in the strictest of confidence. We do not 
  sell any information to any third party. We also maintain a secured web site on all pages that require you 
  to provide any personal information. This policy applies to users of Teaminer services anywhere in the world.<br>

The practices described in this policy are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. This means 
that we only engage in the practices described in this policy in a particular country or region if permitted under 
the laws of those places. Please contact us if you have questions on our practices in your country or region.<br>

<strong>By using the Website and/or the Services and providing us with Personal Information you agree to the practices 
  described in this Privacy Policy and the Cookie Policy referenced below and to the updates to these policies 
  posted here from time to time. To make sure you stay informed of all changes, you should check these policies 
  periodically. Updates will be referenced by the "Last Updated" date shown above. </strong> <br><br>

<strong> 1.	Definition of Personal Information </strong> <br><br>
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, except where a different definition is noted, 
"Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, 
references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.
Personal Information does not include:<br><br>
•	Publicly available information from government records.<br>
•	De-identified or aggregated consumer information.<br>
•	Other information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as:<br>
o	health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical 
Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data;<br>
o	personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California 
Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.<br><br>

<strong>2.	California "Shine the Light" Law/Your California Privacy Rights </strong> <br><br>
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits 
consumers who are California residents, to request and obtain from us once a year, free 
of charge, information about the categories of personal information (as defined in the 
Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third 
parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. Our disclosure requirements 
apply only if we share our consumers’ personal information with third parties for them 
to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with 
our own business. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, 
contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.<br><br>

<strong>3.	What personal information do we collect?  </strong> <br><br>
We may have collected Personal Information in the following categories from consumers within 
the last twelve (12) months. The categories and examples provided in the chart below are those 
defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information 
were in fact collected but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some 
of that information may have been collected about consumers. We will update this disclosure from 
time to time as appropriate.<br>

In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information collected, we will 
investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer 
the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would 
be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is 
otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.<br>

Category	Examples<br><br>
A. Identifiers.	A name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, 
Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license
 number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.<br>
B. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute 
(Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)).	A name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics 
or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification 
card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, 
credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, 
or health insurance information. Some personal information included in this category may overlap 
with other categories.<br>
C. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.	
Age (40 years or older), race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, religion or 
creed, marital status, medical condition, physical or mental disability, sex (including gender, 
gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy or childbirth and related medical conditions), 
sexual orientation, veteran or military status, genetic information (including familial genetic information).<br><br>

D. Commercial information.	Records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or 
considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies<br>
F. Internet or other similar network activity.	Browsing history, search history, information on a 
consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.<br>
G. Geolocation data.	Physical location or movements.<br>
H. Sensory data.	Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information.<br>
I. Professional or employment-related information.	Current or past job history or performance evaluations.<br>
J. Non-public education information (per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99)).	Education records directly related to a 
student maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf, such as 
grades, transcripts, class lists, student schedules, student identification codes, 
student financial information, or student disciplinary records.<br>
K. Inferences drawn from other personal information.	Profile reflecting a person's 
preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, 
intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.<br><br>

Teaminer collects information on the Site at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous 
aggregate information (such as a domain name or IP address) from all visitors to the Site. This 
type of information if never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used 
in the aggregate to general statistical reports about the use of the Site. <br>
Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable information when you use 
the services available for the site. We collect information from you when you register on our 
site, place an order or fill out a form. When ordering or registering on our site, as 
appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone 
number, credit card information, banking information or social security number. You may, 
however, visit our site anonymously. <br>

Like most websites, we use cookies and/or web beacons to enhance your experience, gather 
general visitor information, and track visits to our website. Please refer to the 'do we 
use cookies?' section below for information about cookies and how we use them.<br><br>

<strong>4.	Sources of Personal Information. </strong><br><br>
We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:<br>
•	Directly from you. For example, during account registration from forms you complete, subscriptions you 
purchase or comments you provide on our Websites.<br>
•	Indirectly from you. For example, from observing your actions on our Website.<br>
•	From third parties. For example, third party social networking providers and advertising companies, 
our affiliates and service providers who provide services or information to us. If you do not want us 
to collect information from social networks, you should review and adjust your privacy settings on those 
networks as desired before linking or connecting them to our Websites.<br>
•	From publicly available sources. For example, online database searches.<br><br>

<strong> 5.	Use and Disclosure ("Sale") of Personal Information </strong><br><br>
We may have "sold" (as that term is defined in the CCPA) Personal Information in the following categories 
from consumers within the last twelve (12) months. Please note that the CCPA uses an expanded definition of 
the term, in which "sell" means:<br>

"Selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating 
orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a third 
party for valuable consideration; or (B) sharing orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's 
personal information with a third party, whether for valuable consideration or for no consideration, for the third 
party's commercial purposes."<br>

When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of benefit 
to our Teaminer in return for sharing Personal Information, but not necessarily received any money in exchange.
The categories below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of 
Personal Information were in fact "sold" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that 
some of that information may have been shared for value in return. We will update this disclosure from time to 
time as appropriate.<br>
In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information "sold," we will investigate and 
provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices 
outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy 
discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.<br><br>

<strong> Category: </strong> <br><br>
•	Identifiers.<br>
•	Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute.<br>
•	Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.<br>
•	Commercial information.<br>
•	Internet or other similar network activity.<br>
•	Geolocation data.<br>
•	Sensory data.<br>
•	Professional or employment-related information.<br>
•	Non-public education information.<br>
•	Inferences drawn from other personal information.<br><br>

<strong> 6.	Use of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes. </strong> <br><br>

We may use or disclose Personal Information we collect for "business purposes" or "commercial purposes" 
(as defined under the CCPA), which may include the following examples. The examples provided are 
illustrative and not intended to be exhaustive.<br><br>

(a) Auditing Interactions with Consumers. For example: monitoring traffic to our Websites, counting ad 
impressions, and auditing legal and regulatory compliance.<br>

(b) Security. For example, maintaining the safety, security, and integrity of our Website, products 
and Services, databases and other technology assets and our business, including preventing fraud, 
detecting security breaches and prosecuting violators, and responding to law enforcement requests 
and meeting requirements of applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.<br>

processing your purchases, transactions, and payments, hosting our Websites, fulfilling subscription orders, 
managing databases, performing analyses, billing, and marketing services such as managing promotions and contests.<br>

for promotions or contests, or to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, 
or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, in which Personal Information we hold is among the assets transferred.<br><br>

If we decide to collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected for 
materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes we will update this Privacy Policy.<br>

In response to a verified consumer request to know what Personal Information was collected or sold, we will investigate 
and provide an individualized response to the consumer, which will include the business or commercial purpose for 
collecting and/or sharing that information. We will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined 
in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all 
the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.<br><br>

collect with third parties. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information.<br><br>

<strong>  8.	Your CCPA Privacy Rights and Choices </strong> <br><br>

The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information as described below.<br><br>

(a) Right to Know about Personal Information Collected or "Sold"<br>

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of 
your Personal Information over the past 12 months. After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer 
request, we will disclose to you within the time required by the CCPA, the relevant information, which may include:<br><br>

•	The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.<br>
•	The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.<br>
•	Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.<br>
•	The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.<br>

1.	sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and<br>
2.   disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.<br><br>

(b) Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information<br>

You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, 
subject to certain exceptions, including if we need the Personal Information for a reason related to our business, such as:<br><br>

1.	providing goods or Services to you;<br>
2.	detecting and resolving issues related to security or functionality;<br>
3.	complying with legal obligations;<br>
4.	conducting research in the public interest;<br>
5.	exercising free speech or insuring another’s exercise of free speech; or<br>
6.	using the information for internal purposes that a consumer might reasonably expect.<br><br>

After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your Personal Information 
from our records within the time period required by the CCPA, unless an exception applies.<br><br>

<strong>  8.1		Exercising Your Rights </strong> <br><br>
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us through the web form 
link provided below in Contact Us.<br>

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.<br>

The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
 the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: <br>
 providing your email and phone verification, known customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or 
 other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information in question.<br>

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority 
to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.<br>

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal 
Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.<br><br>

<strong> 8.2	 	Response Timing and Format </strong> <br><br>
We use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. 
If we need more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and the needed extension period in writing.<br>

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account 
with us, we will deliver our written response by email.<br>

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. 
If we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable.
 For data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information 
 that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
  hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a fee to process or 
  respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we 
  determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a 
  cost estimate before completing your request.<br><br>

<strong>8.3		Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights </strong> <br><br>
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. In particular, we will not:<br>

•	Deny you goods or services.<br>
•	Charge you different prices for goods or services, whether through denying benefits or imposing penalties.<br>
•	Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.<br>
•	Threaten you with any of the above.<br><br>

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, 
rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your 
Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. 
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<br>

We currently do not offer any financial incentive, benefit, or price differences in return for the disclosure, 
deletion, or sale of Personal Information. However, in general, our business model is based on providing a 
certain amount of monthly free content to readers, after which we may require that additional content access 
must be paid for. On some of our Websites and apps, this content may be paid for either through the delivery 
of advertisements, or through subscriptions. On those Websites and apps, consumers who use ad-blocking technology 
will be notified of the option to turn off the ad blocking or to pay for a subscription to access the content. On 
some other Websites and apps, content must be paid for after a certain number of monthly free articles, whether 
advertising is present or not.<br><br>

<strong> 9.	Do Not Sell My Personal Information. </strong>  <br><br>

The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can opt out of the ''sale" 
of their Personal Information. The link to our Do Not Sell web form is located here.<br>

In addition, you may opt out of certain interest-based advertising by using the following resources:<br><br>

(a) You may opt-out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile 
advertising companies and other similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices.<br>

(b) You may opt-out of receiving permissible targeted advertisements by using the NAI Opt-out tool available at 
optout.networkadvertising.org or visiting About Ads.<br>

(c) You may opt-out of having your activity on our Websites and Services made available to coo Analytics by 
installing the Google Analytics opt-out add-on for your web browser by visiting: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout 
for your web browser.<br><br>


 <strong> 10.	What do we use your information for? </strong>  <br><br>
Teaminer collects a variety of information for many different purposes that are related to the use and sale 
of our products. These purposes include product interest and purchasing trends, credit information, payment 
information, contact information, usage information as it relates to our products, service requirements. We 
do this to develop a good understanding of your needs, analyze those needs and respond to those needs. This 
is done to identify products and services offered by our Teaminer affiliates or by other companies that we 
believe could be of interest to you. When doing so, we may offer these products or services to you for your
 purchasing consideration.<br>

Further to the above, any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: <br><br>

. To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs) .<br>
. To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback
 we receive from you).<br>
. To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service 
requests and support needs).<br>
. Perform internal operations necessary to provide our services, including to troubleshoot software bugs and 
operational problems, to conduct data analysis, testing, and research, and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends.<br><br>

. Verify your identity <br>
. To process transactions. Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose 
of delivering the purchased product or service requested.<br>
. To administer a contest, promotion, survey, or other site feature.<br>
. To send periodic emails.  The email address you provide for order processing, may be used to send you information
 and updates pertaining to your order, in addition to receiving occasional Teaminer news, updates, related product 
 or service information, etc.<br>
. Legal proceedings and requirements. We may use the information we collect to investigate or address claims or 
disputes relating to your use of Teaminer's services, or as otherwise allowed by applicable law, or as requested 
by regulators, government entities, and official inquiries.<br><br>

<strong>  Note: </strong>  If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include 
detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.<br><br>

<strong>11.	How do we protect your information?  </strong> <br><br>
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place 
an order or access your personal information. Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. <br>
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with 
special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. All transactions are processed 
through a third party via SSL API. We do not store date OF ANY KIND on this website with exception to the fields noted herein.<br> 
After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will be kept on file 
for more than 60 days in order to facilitate future orders as some customers maintain ongoing, monthly purchasing transactions 
with Teaminer. <br>
If you register with us, your online account information is protected by a password chosen by you. The site does not 
store plaintext (human-readable) passwords, nor does it store encrypted (computerdecryptable) passwords. Alternatively, 
this site uses password hashes and if exposed/compromised, cannot reveal your human-readable password. This is to help 
limit any further use of your password on unrelated sites. Access to that online account requires your username and password.
