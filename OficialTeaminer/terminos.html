             signed by an officer of Teaminer. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or held 
             to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected and this Agreement as 
             much as possible under applicable law shall continue in full force and effect as if such unenforceable 
             provision had never constituted a part hereof and the unenforceable provision shall be automatically 
             amended so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable provision within the limits of 
             applicable law. <br>
            Teaminer reserves the right to revise these provisions at its discretion and without notice, so check 
            back from time to time to be sure You are complying with the current version.
