        <h1>  TEAMINER <br>
            Policies and Procedures </h1>
        <p>   
           
            
            
            
           <STRong> SECTION 1 - CODE OF ETHICS</STRong><br><br>
            
                Teaminer has made a commitment to provide blockchain products to its Independent Members.  In turn, the company expects Teaminer Independent Members to reflect that image in their relationships with Customers and fellow Independent Members.
            
                As a Teaminer Independent Member you are expected to operate your business according to the highest standards of integrity and fair practice in your role as a Teaminer Independent Member. Failure to comply with the Code of Ethics can result in your termination as a Teaminer Independent Member.  The Code of Ethics, therefore, states:
            
                As an Independent Member:<br><br>
            
            •	I will conduct my business in an honest, ethical manner at all times.<br>
            •	I will make no representations about the benefits of being an Independent 
            Member with Teaminer other than those contained in officially-approved corporate literature and videos.<br>
            •	I will provide support and encouragement to my customers to ensure that their 
            experience with Teaminer is a successful one.  <br>
            •	I will motivate and actively work with Independent Members 
            of my downline organization to help them build their Teaminer
             business. I understand that that this support is critical to 
             each Independent Member’s success with Teaminer.<br>
            •	I will refrain from exaggerating my personal income or the 
            income potential in general and will stress to Independent Member 
            prospects the level of effort and commitment required to succeed in the business.<br>
            •	I will not abuse the goodwill of my association with Teaminer to further or 
            promote other business interests (particularly those which may be competitive to
             Teaminer) without the prior written consent of Teaminer.<br>
            •	I will not make disparaging remarks about other products, services, 
            Independent Members, or companies; likewise, I will not willfully denigrate
             the activities or personalities of fellow Teaminer Independent Members.<br>
            •	I will abide by all of the Policies and Procedures of Teaminer as
             included herein, or as may be amended from time to time.<br>
            •	I will not make any payment(s) or promise to pay any prospective 
            or existing Independent Member in return for such Independent Member’s 
            enrollment, continued enrollment, or team building or recruiting activities with Teaminer.<br>
            •	I will strive to sell and promote the products of Teaminer in a professional manner to end user retail customers. <br><br>
            
            <STRong>SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION</STRong><br><br>
            
            2.1 - Policies and Compensation Plan Incorporated into Independent Member Agreement
            These Policies and Procedures, in their present form and as amended at the sole 
            discretion of Teaminer, are incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the 
            Teaminer Independent Member Agreement. Throughout these Policies, when the term
             “Agreement” is used, it collectively refers to the Teaminer Independent Member 
             Application and Agreement Form, these Policies and Procedures and the Teaminer
              Compensation Plan. These documents are incorporated by reference into the Teaminer 
              Independent Member Agreement (all in their current form and as amended by Teaminer).<br><br>
            
            2.2 - Purpose of Policies<br>
            Teaminer is a direct sales company that markets health and wellness supplements 
            and other related products, through Independent Members. It is important to understand 
            that your success and the success of your fellow Independent Members depends on the
             integrity of those who market our services. To clearly define the relationship that 
             exists between Independent Members and Teaminer, and to explicitly set a standard for
              acceptable business conduct, Teaminer has established the Agreement.  Teaminer Independent 
              Members are required to comply with all of the provisions set forth in the Agreement, 
              which Teaminer may amend at its sole discretion from time to time, as well as with all
               federal, state and local laws governing their Teaminer business and their conduct. 
               Because you may be unfamiliar with many of these standards of practice, it is very 
               important that you read and abide by the Agreement. Please review the information in 
               this document carefully. It explains and governs the relationship between you, as an
                independent contractor, and the Company. If you have any questions regarding any policy 
                or rule, do not hesitate to seek an answer from the Teaminer corporate office.<br><br>
            
            2.3 - Changes to the Agreement<br>
            Because laws and the business environment periodically change, Teaminer reserves the 
            right to amend the Agreement, compensation plan and its prices at its sole and absolute 
            discretion. By signing the Independent Member Agreement, an Independent Member agrees to 
            abide by all amendments or modifications that Teaminer elects to make. Amendments shall
             be effective 30 days after publication of notice of amendments in official Teaminer materials.
              The Company shall provide or make available to all Independent Members a complete copy of 
              the amended provisions by one or more of the following methods: (a) posting on the Company’s 
              official website; (b) electronic mail (email); (c) inclusion in Company periodicals; (d) 
              inclusion with commissions or bonus checks; or (e) special mailings. The continuation of an 
              Independent Member’s Teaminer business or an Independent Member’s acceptance of bonuses or 
              commissions constitutes acceptance of any and all amendments.<br><br>
            
            2.4 - Delays<br>
            Teaminer shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance of its obligations 
            when performance is made commercially impracticable due to circumstances beyond its reasonable 
            control. This includes, without limitation, strikes, labor difficulties, riot, war, fire, death, 
            curtailment of a party’s source of supply, government decrees or orders, and acts of God.<br><br>
            
            2.5 - Policies and Provisions Severable<br>
            If any provision of the Agreement, in its current form or as may be amended, is found to be invalid, 
            or unenforceable for any reason, only the invalid portion(s) of the provision shall be severed and 
            the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed as 
            if such invalid or unenforceable provision never comprised a part of the Agreement.<br><br>
            
            2.6 - Waiver<br>
            The Company never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement and with the applicable 
            laws governing the conduct of a business. No failure of Teaminer to exercise any right or power under 
            the Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by an Independent Member with any obligation or 
            provision of the Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of 
            the Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of Teaminer’s right to demand exact compliance with the
             Agreement. Waiver by Teaminer can be affected only in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. 
             Teaminer’s waiver of any particular breach by an Independent Member shall not affect or impair Teaminer’s 
             rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of 
             any other Independent Member. Nor shall any delay or omission by Teaminer to exercise any right arising 
             from a breach affect or impair Teaminer’s rights as to that or any subsequent breach. The existence of 
             any claim or cause of action of an Independent Member against Teaminer shall not constitute a defense to 
             Teaminer’s enforcement of any term or provision of the Agreement.<br><br>
            
            <strong> SECTION 3 - BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER</strong> <br><br>
            
            3.1 - Requirements to Become an Independent Member
            To become a Teaminer Independent Member, each applicant must:<br>
            3.1.1 - Be at least 18 years of age;<br>
            3.1.2 - Reside in the 50 United States or US Territories officially opened by the Company;<br>
            3.1.3 - Have a valid Social Security or Tax ID number;<br>
            3.1.4 -  Submit an accepted Teaminer Independent Member Application and Agreement.<br><br>
            
            The Company reserves the right to reject any applications for a new Independent Member or applications for renewal.<br>
            
            3.2 - Independent Member Benefits<br>
            Once an Independent Member Application and Agreement has been accepted by Teaminer, the following benefits are 
            available to the new Independent Member. <br><br>
            
            3.2.1 – Independent Members that enroll in Teaminer are allowed to:<br><br>
            -Sell Teaminer products to retail customers and receive profit from these sales<br>
            - Receive periodic Teaminer literature and other Teaminer communications<br>
            -Build a network of Independent Independent Members and participate in the Teaminer Compensation Plan<br><br>
              
            
            <strong> SECTION 4 - OPERATING A TEAMINER BUSINESS</strong> <br><br>
            
            4.1 - Adherence to the Teaminer Compensation Plan
            Independent Members must adhere to the terms of the Teaminer Compensation Plan as set forth in official Teaminer literature.<br><br>
            
            Independent Members shall not offer the Teaminer opportunity through, or in combination with, any other system, program 
            or method of marketing other than that specifically set forth in official Teaminer literature. Independent Members shall
             not require or encourage other current or prospective customers or Independent Members to participate in Teaminer in 
             any manner that varies from the program as set forth in official Teaminer literature. Independent Members shall not 
             require or encourage other current or prospective customers or Independent Members to execute any agreement or contract 
             other than official Teaminer agreements and contracts in order to become a Teaminer Independent Member. Similarly, 
             Independent Members shall not require or encourage other current or prospective customers or Independent Members to 
             make any purchase from, or payment to, any individual or other entity to participate in the Teaminer Compensation Plan 
             other than those purchases or payments identified as recommended or required in official Teaminer literature.<br><br>
            
            4.2 - Bonus Buying Prohibited<br>
            Bonus buying is strictly and absolutely prohibited. “Bonus buying” includes: <br>
            (a) the enrollment of individuals without their knowledge and agreement and/or without execution of an Independent 
            Member Application; <br>
            (b) the fraudulent enrollment of an individual as an Independent Member or merchant; <br>
            (c) the enrollment or attempted enrollment of non-existent individuals as Independent Members or merchants;<br>
            (d) the use of a credit card by or on behalf of an Independent Member or merchant when the Independent Member or 
            customer is not the account holder of such credit card; <br>
            (e) purchasing Teaminer products on behalf of another Independent Member, or under another Independent Member’s
             ID number, to qualify for commissions or bonuses.<br><br>
            
            4.3 - Business Entities <br>
            A Partnership, LLC or Corporation may hold an Independent Member business upon completion of the
             Independent Member Application form, and providing on that form in the appropriate space, a Federal
              tax ID number. An individual may participate in multiple business centers; however, all must be under 
              the same business name.  The person signing the application on behalf of a business entity must have 
              the authority of said entity for entering into the transaction.  In addition, by signing for as a business 
              entity, you certify that no person with an interest of debt or equity in the business has had an interest
               in an Independent Member business in Teaminer within six (6) months of the date of signature.<br><br>
            
            4.4 - Changes to a Teaminer Business<br>
            4.4.1 - General
            Each Independent Member must immediately notify Teaminer of all changes to the information contained 
            in his or her Independent Member Application and Agreement. Independent Members may modify their existing 
            Independent Member Agreement Form by submitting a written request and appropriate supporting documentation.<br><br>
            
            4.4.2 - Change of Sponsor<br>
            To protect the integrity of all marketing organizations and safeguard the hard work of all Independent Members, 
            Teaminer does not allow changes in sponsorship for active Independent Members. Maintaining the integrity of 
            sponsorship is critical for the success of every Independent Member and marketing organization. Accordingly, 
            the transfer of a Teaminer business from one sponsor to another is not permitted.<br><br>
            
            Exception - A request for a change in sponsor, due to Teaminer error, will be accepted within 45 days of 
            completion of the application.<br><br>
            
            4.4.3 - Cancellation and Re-application<br>
            An Independent Member may legitimately change organizations by:<br>
            a) Voluntarily cancelling his or her Teaminer Agreement and remaining inactive 
            (i.e., no purchases of Teaminer products for resale; no sales of Teaminer products; 
            no sponsoring; and no attendance at any Teaminer functions, participation in any other 
            form of Independent Member activity, or operation of any other Teaminer business) for 6 full calendar months.<br><br>
            
            Following the 6-calendar month period of inactivity, the former Independent Member may reapply under a new sponsor. 
             However, the former Independent Member will permanently lose any and all right to their former Independent Member 
             downline organization.<br><br>
            
            4.5 - Unauthorized Claims and Actions
            4.5.1 - Indemnification
            An Independent Member is fully responsible for all of his or her verbal and written statements made 
            regarding Teaminer products, services, and the Compensation Plan that are not expressly contained in 
            official Teaminer materials. Independent Members agree to indemnify Teaminer and Teaminer’s directors, 
            officers, employees and agents and hold them harmless from any and all liability, including judgments, 
            civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs or lost business incurred by Teaminer as a result 
            of the Independent Member’s unauthorized representations or actions. This provision shall survive the 
            termination of the Independent Member Agreement.<br><br>
            
            4.5.2 - Income Claims<br>
            In their enthusiasm to enroll prospective Independent Members, some Independent Members are occasionally 
            tempted to make income claims or earnings representations to demonstrate the inherent power of network 
            marketing. This is counterproductive because new Independent Members may become disappointed very quickly 
            if their results are not as extensive or as rapid as the results others have achieved.<br><br>
            
            Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission and all states have laws or regulations that regulate or even 
            prohibit certain types of income claims and testimonials made by persons engaged in network marketing. 
            While Independent Members may believe it beneficial to provide copies of checks, or to disclose the 
            earnings of themselves or others, such approaches have legal consequences that can negatively impact 
            Teaminer as well as the Independent Member making the claim unless appropriate disclosures required by 
            law are also made contemporaneously with the income claim or earnings representation. Because Independent 
            Members do not have the data necessary to comply with the legal requirements for making income claims, 
            an Independent Member may NOT make income projections, income claims or disclose his or her Teaminer income 
            (including the showing of checks, copies of checks, bank statements or tax records). <br><br>
            
            4.6 - Conduct at Teaminer Events<br>
            4.6.1 - No Selling or Recruiting at Teaminer Events<br>
            Selling and recruiting at Teaminer events is not permitted. These activities take away from the primary 
            focus of the event and can negatively reflect on the professional image of Teaminer as a company. You may,
             however, offer a business card and/or catalog.<br><br>
            
            4.6.2 - No Selling or Recruiting for other Companies at Teaminer Events<br>
            Teaminer Independent Members shall not sell any products or recruit for any business during Teaminer events. 
            This restriction most specifically applies to sales and recruitment efforts for any other direct sales or
             marketing program, regardless of the product category, including those that do not compete with Teaminer’s product line.<br><br> 
            
            4.7 - Conflicts of Interest<br>
            4.7.1 - Non-compete Policy<br>
            Teaminer Independent Members are free to participate in other multilevel or network marketing 
            business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively “network marketing”), with the exception 
            of those products in the same generic category as a Teaminer product that is deemed to be competing. 
             Independent Members may not display Teaminer products with any other products or services in a fashion 
             that might in any way confuse or mislead a prospective customer, merchant or Independent Member into 
             believing there is a relationship between the Teaminer and non-Teaminer products or services.<br><br>
            
            4.7.2 – Non-solicitation<br>
            During the term of this Agreement, Independent Members may not recruit other Teaminer Independent 
            Members or Merchants or customers for any other network marketing business. Following the cancellation 
            of this Agreement, and for a period of one year thereafter, a former Independent Member may not recruit 
            any Teaminer Independent Member or customer for another network marketing business, with the exception of 
            an Independent Member who is personally sponsored by the former Independent Member. The Independent Members 
            and Company recognize that because network marketing is conducted through networks of independent contractors 
            dispersed across the entire United States and internationally, and business is commonly conducted via the 
            Internet and telephone, an effort to narrowly limit the geographic scope of this non-solicitation provision 
            would render it wholly ineffective.  Therefore, the Independent Members and Company agree that this non-solicitation 
            provision shall apply to all markets in which Teaminer conducts business. <br><br>
            
            The term “recruit” means actual or attempted solicitation, enrollment, encouragement or effort to influence in any 
            other way, either directly or through a third party, another Teaminer Independent Member or customer to enroll or 
            participate in another multilevel marketing, network marketing or direct sales opportunity. This conduct constitutes 
            recruiting even if the
            Independent Member’s actions are in response to an inquiry made by another Independent Member or customer.<br><br>
            
            4.7.3- Downline Activity (Genealogy) Reports<br>
            Downline Activity Reports made available for Independent Member access and viewing at Teaminer’s official website, 
            are considered confidential. Independent Member access to their Downline Activity Reports is password protected. All
             Downline Activity Reports and the information contained therein are confidential and constitute proprietary information
              and business trade secrets belonging to Teaminer. Downline Activity Reports are provided to Independent Members in 
              the strictest of confidence and are made available to Independent Members for the sole purpose of assisting Independent 
              Members in working with their respective Downline Organizations in the development of their Teaminer business. <br><br>
            
            Independent Members should use their Downline Activity Reports to assist, motivate and train their Downline Independent Members. 
            The Independent Member and Teaminer agree that, but for this agreement of confidentiality and nondisclosure, Teaminer would 
            not provide Downline Activity Reports to the Independent Member. An Independent Member shall not, on his or her own behalf, 
            or on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity:<br><br>
            
            • Directly or indirectly disclose any information contained in any Downline Activity Report to any third party;<br>
            • Directly or indirectly disclose the password or other access code to his or her Downline Activity Report;<br>
            • Use the information to compete with Teaminer or for any purpose other than promoting his or her Teaminer business;<br>
            • Recruit or solicit any Independent Member or Customer of Teaminer listed on any report or in any manner attempt to influence 
            or induce any Independent Member or customer of Teaminer to alter their business relationship with Teaminer;<br>
            • Use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity any information contained in any 
            Downline Activity Report.<br><br>
            
            Upon demand by the Company, any current or former Independent Member will return the original and all copies of Downline 
            Activity Reports to the Company.<br><br>
            4.8 - Cross-Sponsoring<br>
            Actual or attempted cross-sponsoring is strictly prohibited. “Cross-sponsoring” is defined as the enrollment of an 
            individual or entity that already has a current Customer, Merchant or Independent Member Agreement on file with Teaminer,
             or who has had such an agreement within the preceding 6 calendar months, within a different line of sponsorship. The use 
             of a spouse or relative’s name, trade names, assumed names or fictitious ID numbers to circumvent this policy is prohibited. 
             Independent Members shall not demean, discredit or defame other Teaminer Independent Members in an attempt to entice another 
             Independent Member to become part of the first Independent Member’s marketing organization. If a prohibited organization 
             transfer occurs, Teaminer shall take disciplinary action against the Independent Member(s) who engaged, acquiesced and/or 
             knowingly participated in the improper cross-sponsoring. However, it shall be entirely within Teaminer’s discretion where 
             in the genealogical structure, the cross-sponsored organization in question shall be placed or otherwise distributed.<br><br>
            
            Because equities often exist in favor of both upline organizations, <strong> INDEPENDENT MEMBERS WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF 
                ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR ITS DECISION REGARDING THE FINAL DISPOSITION OR PLACEMENT OF THE CROSSSPONSORED ORGANIZATION.</strong> <br><br>
            
            4.9 - Errors or Questions<br>
            If an Independent Member has questions about or believes any errors have been made regarding commissions, bonuses, 
            Downline Activity Reports, or charges, the Independent Member must notify the Independent Member Care Department at 
            Teaminer’s headquarters in Sheridan County, Wyoming, in writing, within 15 days of the date of the purported error or 
            incident in question. Teaminer will not be responsible for any errors, omissions or problems not reported to the Company 
            within 15 days.<br><br> 
            
            4.10 – Sales Aids Optional
            Independent Members are not required to carry sales aids. Independent Members who do so must make his or her own decision 
            with regard to these matters. To ensure that Independent Members are not encumbered with Company Sales Aids, such Sales Aids
             may be returned to Teaminer upon the Independent Member’s cancellation pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1.<br><br>
            
            4.11 - Governmental Approval or Endorsement<br>
            Neither federal nor state regulatory agencies or officials approve or endorse any direct selling program. Therefore, 
            Independent Members shall not represent or imply that Teaminer or its Compensation Plan have been “approved,” “endorsed”
             or otherwise sanctioned by any government agency.<br><br>
            
            4.12 - Holding Applications or Enrollments<br>
            Independent Members must not manipulate enrollments of new applicants or Merchant enrollments. All Independent Member 
            Applications and Agreements and Service orders must be sent within 72 hours from the time they are signed by an Independent
             Member or placed by a merchant.<br><br>
            
            4.13 - Identification<br>
            All Independent Members are required to provide their Social Security Number or Federal Tax Identification Number to 
            Teaminer on the Independent Member Application and Agreement.
            Upon enrollment, the Company will provide a unique Independent Member Identification Number to the Independent Member 
            by which he or she will be identified. This number will be used to place orders and track commissions and bonuses.<br><br>
            
            4.14 - Income Taxes<br>
            Each Independent Member is responsible for paying local, state and federal taxes on any income generated as an Independent
             Member. If a Teaminer business is tax exempt, the Federal Tax Identification Number must be provided to Teaminer. Every year, 
             Teaminer will provide IRS Form 1099 (non-employee compensation) earnings statement to each U.S. resident who (a) had earnings 
             of over $600 in the previous calendar year or (b) made purchases during the previous calendar year in excess of $5,000 wholesale. 
             Teaminer cannot accept a tax-exempt certificate from an Independent Member who resides in a state where tax exempt status is not
              granted for Direct Sales businesses. Independent Members are encouraged to check with their state government before sending
               a form to Teaminer.<br><br>
            
            4.15 - Independent Contractor Status<br>
            Independent Members are independent contractors and are not purchasers of a franchise or a business opportunity.
             The agreement between Teaminer and its Independent Members does not create an employer/employee relationship, agency,
              partnership or joint venture between the Company and the Independent Member. Independent Members shall not be treated 
              as an employee for his or her services or for federal or state tax purposes. All Independent Members are responsible 
              for paying local, state and federal taxes due from all compensation earned as an Independent Member of the Company. 
              The Independent Member has no authority (expressed or implied) to bind the Company to any obligation. Each Independent 
              Member shall establish his or her own goals, hours, and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms 
              of the Independent Member Agreement Form, and these Policies and Procedures, and applicable laws.  If required by law 
              to declare any Teaminer Members be classified as employees, Teaminer reserves the right to discontinue operating within 
              the jurisdiction making such declaration.<br><br>
            
            The name of Teaminer and other names as may be adopted by Teaminer are proprietary trade names, trademarks and service 
            marks of Teaminer. As such, these marks are of great value to Teaminer and are supplied to Independent Members for their 
            use only in an expressly authorized manner. Use of the Teaminer name on any item not produced by the Company is prohibited 
            except as follows:<br>
            
            Independent Member’s Name<br>
            Independent Teaminer Independent Member<br><br>
            
            All Independent Members may list themselves as an “Independent Teaminer Independent Member” in the residential 
            telephone directory (“white pages”) under their own name. Independent Members may not place telephone directory 
            display ads in the classified directory (“Yellow Pages”) using Teaminer’s name or logo.<br><br>
            
            Independent Members may not answer the telephone by saying “Teaminer,” “Teaminer Processing,” or in any other 
            manner that would lead the caller to believe that he or she has reached the corporate offices of Teaminer.<br><br>
            
            Advertising is not limited to print media; it also includes internet advertising and other forms of advertising.  
            It is prohibited for an Independent Member to use an internet or email address that utilizes the trade name Teaminer,
             or includes Teaminer in a portion of the address.  It is also prohibited for an Independent Member to use any website
              materials on a website that references or relates to Teaminer that is not authorized in writing by Teaminer.  It is 
              also prohibited for an Independent Member to place links to unauthorized websites or webpages onto a website or 
              webpage that has been authorized by Teaminer.<br><br>
            
            4.16 - Insurance<br>
            4.16.1 - Business Pursuits Coverage<br>
            You may wish to arrange insurance coverage for your business. Your homeowner’s insurance 
            policy may not cover business related injuries or the theft of or damage to your business. 
            Contact your insurance agent to make sure that your business property is protected. <br><br>
            
            4.17 - International Marketing<br>
            Because of critical legal and tax considerations, Teaminer must limit the marketing and enrollment 
            of Teaminer services and the presentation of the Teaminer business to prospective customers, 
            Merchants and Independent Members located within the 50 United States of America and any other 
            jurisdiction officially opened by Teaminer. Independent Members are only authorized to do business
             in the countries in which Teaminer has announced are open for business in official Company literature.<br><br>
            
            4.18 - Laws and Ordinances<br>
            Independent Members shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations in the 
            conduct of their businesses. Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain home-based businesses. 
            In most cases these ordinances are not applicable to Independent Members because of the nature of their 
            business. However, Independent Members must obey those laws that do apply to them. If a city or county 
            official tells an Independent Member that an ordinance applies to him or her, the Independent Member shall 
            comply with the law.<br><br>
            
            4.19 - Minors<br>
            Independent Members shall not enroll or recruit individuals under the age of 18 into the Teaminer 
            program.  The one exception to this is if the minor has been adjudicated as an emancipated minor 
            by a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>
            
            4.20 - Actions of Household Members or Independent Memberd Individuals.<br>
            If any member of an Independent Member’s household, family, or other Independent Memberd individual 
            engages in any activity that, if performed by the Independent Member, would violate any provision of 
            the Agreement, such activity will be deemed a violation by the Independent Member and Teaminer may 
            take disciplinary action pursuant to the Statement of Policies against the Independent Member.<br><br>
            
            An exception to the one-business-per-Independent Member rule will be considered on a case-by-case basis 
            if two Independent Members marry. Requests for exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing to
             the Compliance Department.<br><br>
            
            4.21- Legal Status as Independent Member<br>
            Some states have recently passed legislation which further limits and identifies the requirements to 
            maintain Independent contractor status.  It is important to know what your states laws are on this 
            subject.  Teaminer will take no action which may subject them to a situation whereby the Members shall 
            be considered employees.<br><br>
            
            4.22 - Requests for Records<br>
            Any request from an Independent Member for copies of invoices, agreements, Downline activity reports 
            or other records/reports will require a fee of $1.00 per page per copy. This fee covers the expense 
            of mailing and time required to research files and make copies of the records.<br><br>
            
            4.23 - Sale, Transfer or Assignment of Teaminer Business<br>
            4.23.1 – Although a Teaminer business is a privately owned, independently operated business, the sale, 
            transfer or assignment of a Teaminer business, and the sale, transfer or assignment of an interest in 
            a Business Entity that owns or operates a Teaminer Independent Member business, is subject to certain 
            limitations.  If an Independent Member wishes to sell his or her Teaminer business, or interest in a 
            Business Entity that owns or operates a Teaminer business, the following criteria must be met:<br><br>
            
            •	The selling Independent Member must offer Teaminer the right of first refusal to purchase the business 
            on the same terms as agreed upon with a third-party buyer.  Teaminer shall have fifteen (15) days from the 
            date of receipt of the written offer from the seller to exercise its right of first refusal. <br>
            •	The buyer or transferee must become a qualified Independent Member.  Before the sale, transfer or 
            assignment can be finalized and approved by Teaminer, any debt obligations the selling party has with 
            Teaminer must be satisfied.<br>
            •	The selling party must be in good standing and not in violation of any of the terms of the Agreement 
            in order to be eligible to sell, transfer or assign a Teaminer Independent Member business.<br><br>
            
            Prior to selling a Business Entity interest, the selling party must notify Teaminer’s Compliance Department 
            in writing and advise of his or her intent to sell Teaminer’s business or Business Entity interest.  
            The selling party must also receive written approval from the Compliance Department before proceeding with the sale. <br><br> 
            
            4.24 - Separation of a Teaminer Independent Member Business<br>
            In the event of a dissolution of marriage of a Teaminer Independent Member, and a spouse, arrangements 
            must be made to assure that any division of the business assets is accomplished so as not to adversely 
            affect the interests and income of other businesses up or down the line of sponsorship. If the separating 
            parties fail to provide for the best interests of other Independent Members and the Company, Teaminer may 
            be forced to involuntarily terminate the Independent Member Agreement.  Teaminer will make no arrangements 
            without court approval or direction.<br><br>
            
            4.25 - During the pendency of a divorce or dissolution, the Company shall treat the business according to 
            the status quo as existed prior to the filing of the divorce or dissolution.
            Under no circumstances will the Downline Organization of divorcing spouses be divided. Similarly, under no 
            circumstances will Teaminer split commission and bonus checks between divorcing spouses. Teaminer will 
            recognize only one Downline Organization and will issue only one commission check per Teaminer business 
            per commission cycle. Commission checks shall always be issued to the individual whose name appears on 
            the Independent Member Agreement.  Teaminer will in no case be liable or responsible for any error in 
            payment to either party to the divorce.<br><br>
            
            4.26 - Sponsoring<br>
            All active Independent Members in good standing have the right to sponsor and enroll others into Teaminer.
             Each prospective Independent Member has the ultimate right to choose his or her own sponsor. 
             If two Independent Members claim to be the sponsor of the same new Independent Member, the Company 
             shall regard the first application received by the Company as controlling.<br><br>
            
            4.27 - Telemarketing<br>
            The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission each have laws that restrict telemarketing practices.<br><br>
            
            Both federal agencies (as well as a number of states) have “do not call” regulations as part of their telemarketing laws. 
            While you may not consider yourself a “telemarketer” in the traditional sense of the word, these regulations broadly 
            define the term “telemarketer” and “telemarketing” so that your inadvertent action of calling someone whose telephone 
            number is listed on the federal “do not call” registry could cause you to violate the law. Moreover, these regulations
             must not be taken lightly, as they carry significant penalties (up to $11,000.00 per violation).<br><br>
            
            Therefore, Independent Members must not engage in telemarketing relative to the operation of their Teaminer businesses. 
            The term “telemarketing” means the placing of one or more telephone calls to an individual or entity to induce the 
            purchase of a Teaminer product or service, or to recruit them for the Teaminer opportunity. “Cold calls” made 
            to prospective customers or Independent Members that promote either Teaminer’s products or services or the 
            Teaminer opportunity constitute telemarketing and are prohibited. However, a telephone call(s) placed to a 
            prospective customer or Independent Member (a “prospect”) is permissible under the following situations:<br><br>
            • If the Independent Member has an established business relationship with the prospect. An “established business 
            relationship” is a relationship between an Independent Member and a prospect based on the prospect’s purchase, 
            rental or lease of goods or services from the Independent Member, or a financial transaction between the prospect 
            and the Independent Member, within the 18 months immediately preceding the date of a telephone call to induce the 
            prospect’s purchase of a product or service.<br>
            • The prospect’s personal inquiry or application regarding a product or service offered by the Independent Member 
            within the 3 months immediately preceding the date of such a call.<br>
            • If the Independent Member receives written and signed permission from the prospect authorizing the Independent 
            Member to call. The authorization must specify the telephone number(s) that the Independent Member is authorized to call.<br>
            • You may call family members, personal friends and acquaintances. An “acquaintance” is someone with whom you have at 
            least a recent first-hand relationship (i.e., you have recently personally met him or her). Bear in mind, however, 
            that if you make a habit of “card collecting” with everyone you meet and subsequently calling them, the FTC may 
            consider this a form of telemarketing that is not subject to this exemption. Thus, if you engage in calling 
            “acquaintances,” you must make such calls on an occasional basis only and not make this a routine practice.<br><br>
            
            In addition, Independent Members shall not use automatic telephone dialing systems relative to the operation of their 
            Teaminer businesses. The term “automatic telephone dialing system” means equipment which has the capacity to (a) 
            store or produce telephone numbers to be called using a random or sequential number generator and (b) to dial such numbers.<br><br>
            
            <strong> SECTION 5 - OF INDEPENDENT MEMBERS</strong> <br><br>
            5.1 - Change of Address or Telephone<br>
            To ensure timely delivery of products, support materials and commission checks, it is critically important that Teaminer’s 
            files are current. Independent Members planning to move should mail Teaminer corporate office, 30 N. Gould Street, Suite R, 
            Sheridan, WY 82801, their new address and telephone numbers. In the alternative, Independent Member may email Teaminer at 
            customer service email provided on website.  To guarantee proper delivery, two weeks advance notice to Teaminer is recommended 
            on all changes.<br><br>
            
            5.2 - Continuing Development Obligations<br>
            5.2.1 - Ongoing Training<br>
            Any Independent Member who sponsors another Independent Member into Teaminer must perform a bona 
            fide assistance and training function to ensure that his or her Downline is properly operating his 
            or her Teaminer business. Independent Members must have ongoing contact and communication with the 
            Independent Members in their Downline Organizations. Examples of such contact and communication may 
            include, but are not limited to, newsletters, written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone 
            contact, voice mail, electronic mail and the accompaniment of Downline Independent Members to Teaminer 
            meetings, training sessions, and other functions. Upline Independent Members are also responsible to 
            motivate and train new Independent Members in Teaminer product knowledge, effective sales techniques, 
            the Teaminer Compensation Plan and compliance with Company Policies and Procedures. Communication with 
            and the training of Downline Independent Members must not, however, violate Section 4.2 (regarding the 
            development of Independent Member-produced sales aids and promotional materials). Independent Members 
            cannot charge for training.<br><br>
            
            Upon request, every Independent Member should be able to provide documented evidence to Teaminer of his 
            or her ongoing fulfillment of the responsibilities of a sponsor.  <br><br>
            
            5.2.2 - Increased Training Responsibilities<br>
            As Independent Members progress through the various levels of leadership, they will become more experienced 
            in sales techniques, product knowledge and understanding of the Teaminer program. They will be called upon to 
            share this knowledge with lesser-experienced Independent Members within their organization.<br><br>
            
            5.2.3 - Ongoing Sales Responsibilities<br>
            Regardless of their level of achievement, Independent Members have an ongoing obligation to continue to 
            personally promote sales through the generation of new customers or merchants and through servicing their 
            existing customers or merchants.<br><br>
            
            5.3 – Non-disparagement<br>
            Teaminer wants to provide its Independent Members with the best products, compensation plan and service in the industry. 
            Accordingly, we value your constructive criticisms and comments. All such comments should be submitted in writing to 
            the Teaminer corporate offices. While Teaminer welcomes constructive input, negative comments and remarks made in the 
            field by Independent Members about the Company, its products or Compensation Plan serve no purpose other than to sour 
            the enthusiasm of other Teaminer Independent Members. For this reason, and to set the proper example for their Downline, 
            Independent Members must not disparage, demean or make negative remarks about Teaminer, other Teaminer Independent 
            Members, Teaminer’s services, the Compensation Plan or Teaminer’s directors, officers or employees.<br><br>
            
            5.4 - Providing Documentation to Applicants<br>
            Independent Members must provide the most current version of the Policies and Procedures and the Compensation Plan to 
            individuals whom they are sponsoring to become Independent Members before the applicant signs an Independent Member 
            Agreement. Additional copies of Policies and Procedures can be found on the Teaminer website at healerteam.net, or in 
            your business center under the forms section.<br><br>
            
            5.5 - Reporting Policy Violations<br>
            Independent Members observing a policy violation by another Independent Member should submit a written report of the 
            violation directly to the attention of the Teaminer Compliance Department. Details of the incident(s), such as dates, 
            number of occurrences, persons involved and any supporting documentation, should be included in the report.<br><br>
            
            <strong>SECTION 6 -  REQUIREMENTS</strong> <br><br>
            
            6.1 - Product Sales<br>
            The Teaminer Compensation Plan is based upon the sale of Teaminer products and services to end user consumers. Independent 
            Members must fulfill personal and Downline organization sales requirements (as well as meet other responsibilities set 
            forth in the Agreement) to be eligible for bonuses, commissions and advancement to higher levels of achievement. <br><br>
            
            6.2 – Retail Sales<br>
            Teaminer wants to ensure that prices for its products and services are not destabilized when sold through a retailing 
            environment. Therefore, Products sold in a retail environment will be subject to a minimum advertised retail price. 
            The minimum advertised price of Teaminer’s products sold in a retail environment (such as a grocery store, eBay, 
            convenience store, market, etc.) is listed on the Teaminer website. Any Independent Member who knowingly fails to 
            honor the minimum price set by Teaminer for its products and services will be subject to termination. <br><br>
            
            Sales of Teaminer products through on-line auction sites, such as eBay are prohibited, unless such sale is done using a 
            fixed price which is not below the minimum advertised retail price.<br><br>
            
            6.3 - Territory Restrictions<br>
            There are no exclusive territories granted to anyone. No franchise fees are required.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>SECTION 7 -   BONUSES AND COMMISSIONS </strong> <br><br>
            
            7.1 - Bonus and Commission Qualifications<br>
            An Independent Member must be active and in compliance with the Agreement and these policies to qualify for bonuses and 
            commissions. So long as an Independent Member complies with the terms of the Agreement and these policies, Teaminer shall pay 
            commissions to such Independent Member in accordance with the Compensation Plan. The minimum amount for which Teaminer will
             issue a commission payment is $25.00. <br><br>
            
            7.2 - Commission Payments and Promotions<br>
            7.2.1 - Payments, Calculations, and Bonuses<br>
            Commissions will be mailed out in accordance with the Compensation Plan. Commissions will be calculated according to 
            the level for which an Independent Member actually satisfied all of the requirements according to the Compensation 
            Plan rather than the highest rank or title achieved. Commission reports will be provided to Independent Members on-line, 
            via web access.<br>
            7.2.2 - Promotions<br>
            Promotions are determined based on business organization and sales activity for each applicable period.<br><br>
             
            7.3 - Adjustment to Bonuses and Commissions<br>
            7.3.1 - Adjustments for Returned Products<br>
            Independent Members receive bonuses and commissions based on the actual enrollment for services to merchants. When a 
            service is cancelled and refund is authorized by the Company, the bonuses and commissions attributable to the refunded
             service(s) will be deducted in the month in which the refund is given, and continuing every pay period thereafter 
             until the commission is recovered from the Independent Members who received bonuses and commissions on the sales 
             of the refunded service(s).<br><br>
            
            7.4 - Unclaimed Commissions and Credits<br>
            7.4.1 - Independent Members must deposit or cash commission and bonus checks within six months from their date of 
            issuance. A check that remains uncashed after six months will be void. There shall be a $50.00 charge for reissuing a 
            check. These charges shall be deducted from the balance owed to the Independent Member.<br><br>
            
            7.5 - Reports<br>
            All information provided by Teaminer in online or telephonic Downline Activity Reports, including but not limited 
            to personal and group sales volume (or any part thereof), and Downline sponsoring activity is believed to be accurate 
            and reliable. Nevertheless, due to various factors, including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical error; 
            the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of orders; denial of credit card and electronic check payments; returned 
            products; and credit card and electronic check charge-backs, the information is not guaranteed by Teaminer or any 
            persons creating or transmitting the information. All personal and group sales volume information is provided “as is” 
            without warranties, expressed or implied, or representations of any kind whatsoever. In particular, but without 
            limitation, there shall be no warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use or non-infringement.
            To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, Teaminer and/or other persons creating or transmitting 
            the information will in no event be liable to any Independent Member or anyone else for any direct, indirect, 
            consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages that arise out of the use of or access to personal and 
            group sales volume information (including but not limited to lost profits, bonuses, or commissions, loss of 
            opportunity and damages that may result from inaccuracy, incompleteness, inconvenience, delay or loss of the 
            use of the information), even if Teaminer or other persons creating or transmitting the information shall have 
            been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Teaminer or other 
            persons creating or transmitting the information shall have no responsibility or liability to you or anyone 
            else under any tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, products liability or other theory with respect 
            to any subject matter of this agreement or terms and conditions related thereto.<br><br>
            
            Access to and use of Teaminer’s online reporting services and your reliance upon such information is at your own 
            risk. All such information is provided to you “as is.” If you are dissatisfied with the accuracy or quality of the 
            information, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of and access to Teaminer’s online reporting 
            services and your reliance upon the information.<br><br>
            
            <strong> SECTION 8 - RETURNS AND SALES AIDS REPURCHASE</strong><br> <br> 
            
            8.1 - Retail Sales<br> 
            
            Personal service and retail sales to the customer are the foundation of Teaminer.  The entire commission 
            structure is based upon volume of retail sales referred by the individual Independent Member as well as their 
            entire organization.<br> <br> 
            
            8.2 -Voluntary Cancellation of Contract<br> 
            Requests by a Teaminer Independent Member to return their sales aids for a refund will be treated as a request to 
            voluntarily cancel that Independent Member business. If an Independent Member wishes to return sales aids purchased 
            within the last 3-month period, the Company shall repurchase the sales aids and the Independent Member’s Agreement 
            shall be canceled. An Independent Member may only return sales aids purchased by him or her that are in new and 
            resalable condition.<br> <br> 
            
            Upon receipt of the sales aids, the Independent Member will be reimbursed 90% of the cost of the original purchase 
            price(s), not to include shipping and handling charges. If the purchases were made through a credit card, the refund 
            will be credited back to the same account. <br> 
            • Independent Member must inform the company of intent to exercise the sales aid buy-back option within 10 business 
            days of resignation notice.<br> 
            • All products to be returned for refund under this provision must be approved in advance of shipment to Teaminer, by 
            calling the Customer Services Department.<br> 
            • Independent Member will be asked to submit invoices detailing the sales aid items to be returned.<br> 
            • Upon approval from the company, returns may be sent to the company’s headquarters and must be accompanied by an 
            invoice copy for each item.<br> <br> 
            
            8.3 - Montana Residents<br> 
            A Montana resident may cancel his or her Independent Member Agreement within 15 days from the date of enrollment 
            and may receive a full refund within such time period for good and resalable sales aids or trainings that have not been attended.<br> <br> 
            
            <strong> SECTION 9 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS </strong> <br> <br> 
            
            9.1 - Disciplinary Sanctions<br> 
            Violation of the Agreement, these Policies and Procedures or any illegal, fraudulent, deceptive or unethical business 
            conduct by an Independent Member may result, at Teaminer’s discretion, in one or more of the following corrective measures:<br> <br> 
            • Issuance of a written warning or admonition;<br> 
            • Requiring the Independent Member to take immediate corrective measures;<br> 
            • Imposition of a fine, which may be withheld from bonus and commission checks;<br> 
            • Loss of rights to one or more bonus and commission checks;<br> 
            • The withholding from an Independent Member of all or part of the Independent Member’s bonuses and 
            commissions during the period that Teaminer is investigating any conduct allegedly in violation of the 
            Agreement. If an Independent Member’s business is canceled for disciplinary reasons, the Independent 
            Member will not be entitled to recover any commissions withheld during the investigation period;<br> 
            • Suspension of the individual’s Independent Member Agreement for one or more pay periods;<br> 
            • Involuntary termination of the offender’s Independent Member Agreement;<br> 
            • Any other measure expressly allowed within any provision of the Agreement or that Teaminer deems practicable
             to implement and appropriate to equitably resolve injuries caused partially or exclusively by the Independent
              Member’s policy violation or contractual breach; or<br> 
            • In situations deemed appropriate by Teaminer, the Company may institute legal proceedings for monetary 
            and/or equitable relief.<br> <br> 
            
            9.2 - Grievances and Complaints<br> 
            When an Independent Member has a grievance or complaint with another Independent Member regarding any 
            practice or conduct in relationship to their respective Teaminer businesses, the complaining Independent 
            Member should first report the problem to his or her sponsor, who should review the matter and try to 
            resolve it with the other party’s Upline sponsor. If the matter cannot be resolved, it must be reported 
            in writing to the Company. The Company will review the facts and determine if a policy violation has 
            occurred and take appropriate action.<br> <br> 
            
            9.3 - Arbitration<br> 
            Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be 
            settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association or other recognized arbitration 
            service, under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may 
            be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Independent Members waive all rights to trial by jury 
            or to any court. All arbitration proceedings shall be held in the County of Sheridan, State of Wyoming, 
            unless the laws of the state in which an Independent Member resides expressly require the application of 
            its laws, in which case the arbitration shall be held in the capital of that state. All parties shall be 
            entitled to all discovery rights pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. There shall be one 
            arbitrator, an attorney at law, who shall have expertise in business law transactions, with a strong 
            preference being an attorney knowledgeable in the direct selling industry, selected from the panel that 
            the American Arbitration Panel provides. The prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the losing 
            party, OR each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for its own, costs and expenses of arbitration, 
            including legal and filing fees. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties
             and may, if necessary, be reduced to a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This agreement 
             to arbitration shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement.<br> <br> 
            
            Nothing in these Policies and Procedures shall prevent Teaminer from applying to and obtaining from 
            any court having jurisdiction a writ of attachment, a temporary injunction, preliminary injunction, 
            permanent injunction or other relief available to safeguard and protect Teaminer’s interest prior to,
             during or following the filing of any arbitration or other proceeding or pending the rendition of a 
             decision or award in connection with any arbitration or other proceeding.<br> <br> 
            
            9.4 - Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue<br> 
            Jurisdiction and venue of any matter not subject to arbitration shall reside in County of Sheridan,
             State of Wyoming. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern all matters relating to arbitration. The law 
             of the State of Wyoming shall govern all other matters relating to or arising from the Agreement.<br> <br> 
            
            9.4.1 - Louisiana Residents: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Louisiana residents may bring an action 
            against the Company with jurisdiction and venue as provided by Louisiana law.<br> <br> 
            
            
            <strong>SECTION 10 -  INACTIVITY AND CANCELLATION</strong> <br> <br> 
            
            10.1 - Effect of Cancellation<br> 
            So long as an Independent Member remains active and complies with the terms of the Independent Member Agreement 
            and these Policies and Procedures, Teaminer shall pay commissions to such Independent Member in accordance with 
            the Compensation Plan. An Independent Member’s bonuses and commissions constitute the entire consideration for 
            the Independent Member’s efforts in generating sales and all activities related to generating sales (including
             building a Downline Organization). Following an Independent Member’s termination for inactivity, or voluntary 
             or involuntary termination of his or her Independent Member Agreement (all of these methods are collectively
              referred to as “termination”), the former Independent Member shall have no right, title, claim or interest to 
              the marketing organization that he or she operated, or any commission or bonus from the sales generated by the 
              organization. An Independent Member whose business is terminated will lose all rights as an Independent Member
              . This includes the right to sell Teaminer products and services and the right to receive future commissions, 
              bonuses or other income resulting from the sales and other activities of the Independent Member’s former Downline 
              sales organization. In the event of termination, Independent Members agree to waive all rights they may have, 
              including but not limited to property rights, to their former Downline organization and to any bonuses, 
              commissions or other remuneration derived from the sales and other activities of his or her former Downline 
              organization.<br> <br> 
            
            Following an Independent Member’s termination of his or her Independent Member Agreement, the former Independent 
            Member shall not hold himself or herself out as a Teaminer Independent Member. An Independent Member whose 
            Independent Member Agreement is terminated shall receive commissions and bonuses only for the last full pay 
            period he or she was active prior to cancellation (less any amounts withheld during an investigation preceding 
            an involuntary termination).<br> <br> 
            
            10.2 - Involuntary Termination<br> 
            An Independent Member’s violation of any of the terms of the Agreement, including any amendments that may be made 
            by Teaminer in its sole discretion, may result in any of the sanctions listed in Section 9.1, including the 
            involuntary termination of his or her Independent Member Agreement. Cancellation shall be effective on the 
            date on which written notice is mailed, faxed or delivered to an express courier to the Independent Member’s 
            last known address (or fax number), or to his or her attorney, or when the Independent Member receives actual 
            notice of termination, whichever occurs first.<br> <br> 
            
            10.3 - Voluntary Termination<br> 
            An Independent Member has a right to cancel, at any time, regardless of reason. Termination must be submitted 
            in writing to the Company at its principal business address. The written notice must include the Independent 
            Member’s signature, printed name, address and Independent Member ID number. Independent Members who have resigned 
            may re-apply to become an Independent Member with Teaminer after 6 months. An Independent Member’s position is
             subject to termination due to inactivity (i.e., merchant enrollments, no commissions, no sponsoring; and no
              attendance at any Teaminer functions, participation in any other form of Independent Member activity, or
               operation of any other Teaminer business) after being inactive for 6 full calendar months.<br> <br> 
            
            10.4 - Non-Renewal<br> 
            An Independent Member may also voluntarily cancel his or her Independent Member Agreement by failing to maintain 
            the Agreement annually. The Company may also elect not to renew an Independent Member’s Agreement.<br> <br> 
            
            10.5-  Complete Agreement<br> 
            These Policies and Procedures, any and all modifications made by the Company, along with the Terms and Conditions 
            and the Compensation Plan make up the entire agreement between Independent Member and Company.  <br> <br>
